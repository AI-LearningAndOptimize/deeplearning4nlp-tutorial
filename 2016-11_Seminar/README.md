# Deep Learning for NLP - Seminar November 2016

This GIT repository accompanies the [UKP](https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp-home/) seminar on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing held at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

In contrast to other seminars, this seminar focuses on the **usage of deep learning methods**. As programming infrastructure we use Python in combination with [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and [Keras](https://keras.io). The published code uses Python 2.7, Theano 0.8.2 and Keras 1.1.1. You should ensure that you have the frameworks installed in the right version (note: they change quickly).

This seminar is structured into 4 sessions:
1. Feed-Forward Networks for Sequence Classification (e.g. POS, NER, Chunking)
2. Convolutional Neural Network for Sentence / Text Classification (e.g. sentiment classification)
3. Convolutional Neural Network for Relation Extraction (e.g. semantic relation extration)
4. Long-Short-Term-Memory (LSTM)-Networks for Sequence Classificaiton 

The seminar is inspired by an engineering mindset: The beautiful math and complexity of the topic is sometimes neglected to provide instead an easy-to-understand and easy-to-use approach **to use Deep Learning for NLP tasks** (we use what works without providing a full background on every aspect).

At the end of the seminar you should be able to understand the most important aspect of deep learning for NLP and be able to programm and train your own deep neural networks.

In case of questions, feel free to approach [Nils Reimers](https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/people/doctoral-researchers/nils-reimers/).
