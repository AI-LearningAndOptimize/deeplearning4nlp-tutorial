# Deep Learning for NLP - Seminar November 2016

This GIT repository accompanies the [UKP](https://www.ukp.tu-darmstadt.de/ukp-home/) seminar on Deep Learning for Natural Language Processing held at the University of Duisburg-Essen.

In contrast to other seminars, this seminar focuses on the **usage of deep learning methods**. As programming infrastructure we use Python in combination with [Theano](http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/) and [Keras](https://keras.io). The published code uses Python 2.7, Theano 0.8.2 and Keras 1.1.1. You should ensure that you have the frameworks installed in the right version (note: they change quickly).
